Holo is a suite of routing protocols designed to support high-scale and
automation-driven networks.

For a description of what a routing protocol is, please refer to this
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol).

## Architecture

The image below shows the different logical layers of the Holo software stack:

## Features

#### Focus on simplicity and correctness

Holo's main goal is to create a reliable, easy-to-maintain, and
extensible codebase.  With the ever increasing complexity of routing
protocols and their extensions, it's crucial to have routing protocol
implementations built on a robust foundation.  To that end, Holo's
codebase prioritizes simplicity, modularity, and thorough documentation.
Thanks to the strictness of the Rust compiler and extensive unit
tests, it's expected that most regressions will be caught early in the
development cycle of new features.

#### Automation-ready

Holo was developed specifically for high-scale, automation-driven
networks that require programmable configuration and monitoring
using structured and modeled data.  Holo natively implements standard
YANG modules from IETF and supports multiple management interfaces,
including native [gRPC](https://github.com/holo-routing/holo/wiki/gRPC) and
[gNMI](https://github.com/holo-routing/holo/wiki/gNMI).  Additionally, Holo
features a standalone [CLI](https://github.com/holo-routing/holo/wiki/CLI)
that dynamically renders commands from YANG modules and communicates with
the Holo daemon through gRPC.

The changes made to the configuration are processed as transactions,
guaranteeing that either all the changes are applied or none at all.
This feature is a significant facilitator of network automation as it
eliminates the need for error recovery in management applications.  Holo also
supports network-wide transactions involving multiple network devices.
Additional network automation capabilities include confirmed commits and
configuration rollback support.

#### Security

By virtue of being written in a memory-safe language, Holo is immune to a
wide variety of memory-related bugs and security vulnerabilities.  Besides the
safety guarantees provided by Rust, the Holo daemon runs in a chroot jail and
drops privileges at startup.  For certain operations, like binding sockets,
Linux [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
are used to gain the minimum required permission for the least amount of time.

#### Integrated protocol implementations

Some protocols, such as OSPF and RIP, have different versions that are widely
deployed, typically one for IPv4 and another for IPv6.  Holo leverages Rust's
generics to have version-agnostic protocol implementations, where most
of the code is shared by the different protocol versions.  This approach
reduces the maintenance cost of these protocols and facilitates shipping
new features that benefit all protocol versions.

#### Parallelism

Holo makes extensive use of asynchronous operations and relies on the
[Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) runtime to schedule tasks
and run them on a thread pool.  In order to achieve better performance,
both I/O requests and CPU-intensive algorithms are offloaded to separate
tasks, maximizing the utilization of all available CPU cores.  Support
for runtime-agnostic code is planned for the future, once the necessary
abstractions are standardized by the Rust language team.

#### Structured logging

Holo generates log messages that contain structured data, which can be
presented in various formats such as JSON, text, etc.
As logging is carried out through the *tracing* facade, diverse *tracing*
subscribers can be utilized to meet different user requirements. For instance,
logging can be directed to a file, journald, a centralized OpenTelemetry
collector, or any combination of these options with potentially varying
logging levels.

#### Reproducible bugs

Holo provides record-and-replay functionality, enabling easy reproduction
of any user-reported bug.  The Holo daemon can be set up to record the
complete lifespan of a protocol instance to a file. That file can then be
played back on another machine, reproducing the same sequence of events.
While a recording session may last for hours or days, the playback process
should take only a few seconds.  This is feasible thanks to Holo's modular
architecture, where all time-related and I/O operations are performed in
separate tasks and abstracted as event messages.

## Installation

Holo uses unstable Rust features, so building it from the source code requires
a nightly version of the Rust compiler.

For detailed instructions on installation, please refer to the
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

#### Supported Platforms

At present, Holo is only compatible with Linux operating systems.

WebAssembly support is planned for the future. This addition will enable
simulation of large networks from within your browser, making network
experimentation more convenient and accessible to everyone.

#### Getting Started

The easiest way to start using Holo is by using pre-built Docker containers
in combination with the [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/) software.
You can find a variety of pre-configured network topologies at [this
link](https://github.com/holo-routing/containerlab-topologies).  These topologies
can be deployed with a single command, allowing you to test Holo in various
network setups, including interoperability testing with other implementations.

Additionally, Holo can be used wherever a routing stack is required, such
as in software routers, provided that the feature set aligns with your
specific needs.
